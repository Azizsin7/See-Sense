# Data Analysis: Clinical Dataset Auditing

## Overview

This folder contains the analytical scripts used to verify the nutritional
health and safety of the final dataset. By categorizing continuous data into
clinical "buckets," we ensure the See-Sense model is audited for safety
across different carbohydrate densities—a vital step for Type 1 Diabetes
(T1D) applications.

## Diagnostic Scripts & Reports

### [carb_bucket](carb_bucket.py)

This is the core analytical script for this folder. It transforms raw
carbohydrate values into clinical categories to audit dataset balance.

Function: Segments the 251 food classes into four distinct tiers based on their
glycemic density.

  The Clinical Buckets:

  1. Keto/Very Low ($0g - 5g$): Minimal insulin impact.
  2. Low Carb ($6g - 15g$): Minor insulin impact.
  3. Medium Carb ($16g - 30g$): Moderate insulin impact.
  4. High Carb ($31g+$): High insulin impact / High-risk zone.

   Description: This categorization identifies "Dataset Skew." If the training
   data is missing samples in the "High Carb" bucket, the model may
   under-calculate insulin doses for high-risk meals, leading to hyperglycemia

### 📊 Audit Visualization

Filename: [carb_bucket_distribution](carb_bucket_distribution.png)

Description: A bar chart generated by the script showing the volume of images
in each clinical bucket.

Insight: This allows the researcher to visually verify that the model has
sufficient training data for high-risk (high carb) foods.

Here is the Python code for your carb_bucket.py script, followed by the
updated README.md for folder 4_data_analysis.

carb_bucket.py
This script performs the clinical audit by categorizing your data and generating
a distribution plot for your documentation.

## Audit Workflow

Load: Pulls the "Gold Standard" dataset from 2_data_preparation.

Bucket: Applies the logic in carb_bucket.py to categorize every food entry.

Visualize: Generates carb_bucket_distribution.png to check for volume gaps.

Safety Check: If the High Carb (31g+) category has significantly fewer images
than others, the researcher is alerted to a "Clinical Blind Spot."

* Safety Note:
In T1D management, accuracy in the High Carb bucket is non-negotiable. This
audit ensures the model is not biased toward low-carb foods, which would cause
dangerous insulin under-estimations in real-world scenarios
