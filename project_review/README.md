# Project Review

A comprehensive record of the See-Sense project journey, from problem
definition through final delivery. This folder documents team collaboration
norms, learning goals, project constraints, and reflections on each
milestone.

## Purpose

Project Review serves as the central hub for:

- **Retrospectives**: Reflections on what went well, what could improve,
  and lessons learned at each project milestone.
- **Learning Goals**: Personal and team learning objectives aligned with
  project phases.
- **Constraints**: Project limitations, assumptions, and external factors
  that shaped decisions.
- **Collaboration & Norms**: Team agreements on communication, decision-
  making, and working styles.

This documentation ensures transparency, facilitates learning, and creates
an audit trail for clinical-grade project management.

## Folder Contents

### [retrospectives/](retrospectives/)

Milestone-by-milestone reflections covering the full project arc.

- **0_domain_study.md**: Domain research and clinical context
- **0_cross_cultural_collaboration.md**: Team collaboration norms
- **1_problem_identification.md**: Problem scoping and validation
- **1_food_datasets.md**: Dataset selection and sourcing
- **2_data_preparation.md**: Data cleaning and mapping pipeline
- **3_data_exploration.md**: Statistical audit and visualization
- **4_data_analysis.md**: Clinical bucketing and bias detection
- **5_model_training.md**: Deep learning model development
- **6_final_presentation.md**: Final presentation and demo

See [retrospectives/README.md](retrospectives/README.md) for detailed
guidance on each milestone and how to use these documents.

### [learning_goals.md](learning_goals.md)

Personal and team learning objectives:

- Skills to develop (technical and soft skills)
- Knowledge areas to explore
- Growth targets and success metrics
- Alignment with project phases

Update this document as the project progresses and priorities shift.

### [constraints.md](constraints.md)

Project constraints and limitations:

- Technical constraints (hardware, software, data)
- Time and resource constraints
- Scope boundaries
- External dependencies and regulations
- Data privacy and ethical considerations

Understanding constraints shapes realistic planning and risk mitigation.

### [guide.md](guide.md)

Quick reference guide for project review processes and best practices.

## How to Use This Folder

### For Team Onboarding

Start with this README, then review:

1. [constraints.md](constraints.md) - Understand project boundaries
2. [learning_goals.md](learning_goals.md) - Align with team objectives
3. [retrospectives/README.md](retrospectives/README.md) - Learn project arc

### For Mid-Project Check-ins

1. Review the current milestone's retrospective
2. Check progress against learning goals
3. Validate decisions against constraints
4. Update retrospective with emerging insights

### For Post-Project Reflection

1. Read all retrospectives in sequence
2. Identify patterns and themes
3. Extract lessons for future projects
4. Update constraints and learning goals based on actual outcomes

### For Future Iterations

1. Review action items in the final retrospective
2. Use constraints as starting points for scope planning
3. Update learning goals for the next cycle
4. Link new retrospectives to prior milestones for continuity

## Key Project Principles

### Clinical Safety First

Every decision prioritizes Type 1 Diabetes safety. Risk analysis and
ethical review are built into each phase, not added afterward.

### Data-Centric Design

Quality data preparation, validation, and auditing prevent cascading
errors. Invest early in data pipeline hygiene.

### Transparency & Reproducibility

All processes, decisions, and code are documented to enable others to
replicate, audit, and extend the work. This is critical for clinical
research.

### Incremental Validation

Validate early and often. Don't wait until project completion to test
assumptions. Catch problems while they're still small.

### Collaborative Learning

Retrospectives aren't blame exercises—they're learning opportunities.
Document wins and failures equally; both inform future work.

## Getting Started

1. **Read this README** to understand the folder's purpose
2. **Review [constraints.md](constraints.md)** for project boundaries
3. **Check [learning_goals.md](learning_goals.md)** for role's
   focus areas
4. **Start with [retrospectives/0_domain_study.md](retrospectives/
   0_domain_study.md)** for the full project story

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Complete (All milestones 0–6 documented)

**Next Steps**: User testing, clinical validation, regulatory review,
mobile deployment (see final retrospective for details)
